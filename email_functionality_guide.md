3. **Send an email newsletter to raphael.treffny@teleplanforsberg.com**
4. Push updates to the GitHub repository

## Technical Implementation

### Email Function
The `send_email_newsletter()` function handles:
- Converting Markdown content to HTML format
- Setting appropriate email headers
- Sending via Manus email system
- Error handling and status reporting

### Integration
The email functionality is integrated into the main automation script (`generate_and_push_report.py`) and runs as part of the daily scheduled task.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Success Indicators
When the script runs successfully, you'll see:
```
✓ Email newsletter sent successfully to raphael.treffny@teleplanforsberg.com
✓ Email newsletter sent successfully!
```

### Error Handling
If email sending fails, the script will:
- Continue with other operations (website update, GitHub push)
- Log the error for debugging
- Display error message in the console

## Email Content Preview

The email will contain the same content as the website but formatted for email readability:

**Subject**: Daily AI News Report - July 07, 2025

**Content Structure**:
- Header with date

1. **Change recipient**: Update the `recipient_email` variable in `generate_and_push_report.py`
2. **Modify email format**: Edit the `generate_email_content()` function
3. **Change subject line**: Modify the subject format in `send_email_newsletter()`
4. **Add multiple recipients**: Extend the email function to support multiple addresses
